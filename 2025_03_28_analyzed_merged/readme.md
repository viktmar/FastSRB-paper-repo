This folder contains the processed output files.
All the fail-fails, which record expressions that are potential new acceptables are processed and deleted, meaning that if a new acceptable was found, it was added to the output file of the run.

The following three were removed from all statistics due to repeated SymPy issues:

- pysr
    - B4 and B11 failed -> removed from results and joblogfile
- tisr
    - III.9.52 failed -> removed from results and joblogfile
